* http://stella.report

* Most people in the field are practitioner researchers
* J. Paul Reed in Lund U. @nora_js @caseyrosenthal
* Fundamental View
** Starting with where and what.
*** Above the line
**** The people and where work gets done
**** Above the line interacts with things below the line via the line of representation
*** Below the line
**** The services and machines
*** You never see things below the line, you see a represenation
**** The represenations are extra important because they are your hands and eyes.
*** Above the line is about cognitive activities that get the real work done.
*** We work in concepts and models.
*** Both parts are changing over time.
**** The conception you have is contextual to what your drawing.
** Above the line is not culture, its cognition.
*** How does our software work, really?
*** How does our software break, really?
*** What do we do to keep it all working?
*** How long would your system stay up if you touched nothing, including responding to pages?
** We study incidents
*** Incidents bring everyones attention to a specific place and time.
*** All incidents are suprises
**** Incidents are like a joke, you dont expect it and it suprises you.
